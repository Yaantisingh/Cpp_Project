Railway Management System Project

Overview
The Railway Management System is a comprehensive project developed in C++ using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. This system provides functionalities such as user sign-up, login, train search, ticket booking, food ordering, and payment processing. It also incorporates C++ file handling and advanced concepts like function overloading and local classes.

Features:
User Authentication
     Sign-up new users
     Login existing users

Train Search
    Search trains by train number
    Search trains by train name
    Search trains between source and destination stations (Implemented using function overloading)

Ticket Booking
     Book tickets for selected trains

Food Ordering
     Order food during the journey

Payment Processing
     Make payments for tickets and food orders


Technical Concepts Demonstrated:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Classes and Objects
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction

Function Overloading
     Implemented for searching trains by different parameters

File Handling in C++
     Storing user data
     Storing train information

Local Classes
      Utilized within functions for specific tasks
